# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This project serves as a resource to learn, implement, and practice various data structures and algorithms. It is designed for anyone looking to strengthen their foundational programming skills and prepare for coding interviews, competitive programming, or academic learning.
